# Wholesome-Possum-Potatoes
Explore the lore of a fun possum named Stebe through a series of whacky mini games

Our website was built on wix, so most of our work can be found there! You can find our published website [here](https://cocacoda123.wixsite.com/wholesome-possums).

## Using Wix's online builder
We used velo by Wix which is an online platform that allows us to drag and drop elements to design the website. There are also many APIs for us to use and it was easy to do so because of their well-documented [API reference](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/api-overview/introduction).
