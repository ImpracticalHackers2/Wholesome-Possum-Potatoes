Our website was built on wix, so most of our work was done there! You can find our published website [here](https://cocacoda123.wixsite.com/wholesome-possums).

## Using Wix's online builder
We used velo by Wix which is an online platform that allows us to drag and drop elements to design the website. There are also many APIs for us to use and it was easy to do so because of their well-documented [API reference](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/api-overview/introduction).

### Another example: editing the FartyParty minigame

As you can see, it's possible to view the code alongside the actual drag-and-drop builder, which makes it easier to reference the .

The online code editor also gives suggestions, which is nifty and helps to ensure we don't make silly mistakes!
